## Key Roles and Resposiblities
1. Event organization: We organize virtual and physical events all year round including training, workshops, hackathons, meet ups, science cafes and more. This usually involves curriculum development, coming up with a program, assisting trainers, etc.
2. Website management: We run a website where we update all our activities and more for more people to reach us. This usually includes coming up with graphics and ensuring the information is up to date.
3. Social media management: This involves running the BHKi Twitter account and communicating important information concerning BHKi or bioinformatics in general. It also involves some graphics including poster design.
4. Communicaton management: This involves community engagement, finding information to constantly keep our community engaged including finding and putting up opportunities in the slack channel.
5. Documentation: This involves documentation of all aspects of BHKi in a manner that ensures efficient running of operations.  

We encourage our members to reach out if they would like to volunteer in any of these capacities.

## Reporting mistakes and bugs
You can report bugs and mistakes by creating an [issue](https://github.com/bioinformatics-hub-ke/bioinformatics-hub-ke.github.io/issues/new) which describes the bug or mistake.

## Creating online materials
You are welcomed to create training materials to help the members to have a aconstant source of reference materials to learn from.
If you are interested in sharing or creating learning materials relevant to the bioinformatics field kindly create an issue describing
the type of content you want to create and it shall be reviewed for you to be added as an external collaborator to the hub. These materials
will be used occassionally during the hub meet ups and training activities.

## Questions and ideas
If you have questions, ideas and suggestions kindly create an issue and we will reach out promptly.

## Documentation improvements and new features
You can help us address our current [open issues](https://github.com/bioinformatics-hub-ke/bioinformatics-hub-ke.github.io/issues) or create new issues which enhance improvements.

Here are a few ways you can get started in contributing;
1. Create a fork of this repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork of this repository to create a local copy on your computer
3. Create a new branch in your local copy for each significant change
4. Commit the changes in that branch
5. Push that branch to your fork on GitHub
6. Submit a pull request from that branch to the master repository
7. If you receive feedback, make changes in your local clone and push them to your branch on GitHub: the pull request will update automatically
8. Pull requests will be merged by the training team members after at least one other person has reviewed the Pull request and approved it.
