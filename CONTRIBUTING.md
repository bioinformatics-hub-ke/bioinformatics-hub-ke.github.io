## Reporting mistakes and bugs
You can report bugs and mistakes by creating an [issue](https://github.com/bioinformatics-hub-ke/bioinformatics-hub-ke.github.io/issues/new) which describes the bug or mistake.

## Creating online materials
You are welcomed to create training materials to help the members to have a aconstant source of reference materials to learn from.
If you are interested in sharing or creating learning materials relevant to the bioinformatics field kindly create an issue describing
the type of content you want to create and it shall be reviewed for you to be added as an external collaborator to the hub. These materials
will be used occassionally during the hub meet ups and training activities.

## Questions and ideas
If you have questions, ideas and suggestions kindly create an issue and we will reach out promptly.

## Documentation improvements and new features
You can help us address our current [open issues](https://github.com/bioinformatics-hub-ke/bioinformatics-hub-ke.github.io/issues) or create new issues which enhance improvements.

Here are a few ways you can get started in contributing;
1. Create a fork of this repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork of this repository to create a local copy on your computer
